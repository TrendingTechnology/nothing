## About project

Inspired by this [tweet](https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1510746150671990785?s=20&t=0ZJS--9rpjO4k1AcLdzZtA).

> :warning: **This project is proof of design concept only. Not a real or final product!**

There is no bluetooth logic connection to headphones, or other real functionality. Just design and animations.
